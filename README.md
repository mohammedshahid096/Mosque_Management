# Mosque Management System

## Overview

The **Mosque Management System** is an open-source project dedicated to helping mosque communities streamline essential services and foster better communication with community members. This application offers a comprehensive solution for managing mosque activities and facilitating community engagement, with features designed specifically to meet the needs of mosque attendees and administrators.

By providing a platform for users to view namaz (prayer) timings, event schedules, and other mosque-related information, this project aims to bring convenience and accessibility to the mosque community. Whether it’s staying informed about prayer times or receiving updates on mosque events, our goal is to enhance the experience for everyone involved.

This project welcomes contributions from developers, designers, and community members. We hope to create a tool that is both functional and valuable, driven by the feedback and collaboration of the open-source community.
